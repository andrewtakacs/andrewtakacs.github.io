            <h3>Project 1: Senior Capstone Project - Kenworth T680 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Fixture</h3>
            <p>This project involved designing and building a specialized fixture to align and secure the eMotor and transmission for the assembly process of the Kenworth T680 Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle. The project included prototype iterations, force analysis, and Factor of Safety (FOS) validation.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Hydrogen Laboratory Research Assistant</h3>
            <p>At the Hydrogen Laboratory, I managed a team to implement production spaces for a 5,800 square foot graduate research lab. I utilized Six Sigma techniques and performed Hazard and Operability (HAZOP) analysis to assess risks in cryogenic hydrogen research. I also optimized wiring for liquid hydrogen experiments, improving connections by 68% and cutting costs by 50%.</p>

        <li class="project-item">
            <h3>Project 4: Fluid Dispersion Systems for Space Environments</h3>
            <p>As part of the Cougs in Space project, I worked on the design and optimization of fluid dispersion systems to be used in space environments. This involved testing different configurations to ensure efficiency and safety in zero-gravity conditions.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="project-item">
            <h3>Project 5: Teaching Assistant for Introductory SolidWorks Course</h3>
            <p>I served as a TA for an introductory SolidWorks course, helping organize assignments, provide office hours, and occasionally teach the class. The role enhanced my leadership and technical skills while assisting 28 students over 14 weeks.</p>
